The provided C code implements a Round Robin scheduling algorithm for managing processes in a simulated operating system environment.
The code effectively simulates a Round Robin scheduling mechanism, which is commonly used in time-sharing systems.
It calculates and displays important metrics for each process, such as waiting time and turnaround time, which are crucial for evaluating the performance of scheduling algorithms.
The implementation is straightforward and can be easily modified or extended for additional features, such as input validation or handling edge cases.
